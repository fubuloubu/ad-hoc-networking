\section{Methodology}
The simulation is developed in several components.
The first stage of the simulation is the map creation layer,
which places N users (cellular devices) randomly on an \textit{n x m} map at a
given (x, y) coordinate with a given starting radius (communication range).
The map creation stage can be instantiated for a new simulation dynamically, 
but additional methods exist to process files containing generated lists of 
users so that statically determined arrangements can be tried.
This layer is leveraged to create several static lists of different quantity
and arrangements of users, which were used for analysis by the main simulation.
As an example, Figure \ref{fig:usergraph} is the user-list
generated for the Intensity Ratio simulation.
Each user is modeled as a black point with the radius of the user colored in
for visualization purposes.

The second stage is the main simulation.
This stage took a list of users, as described previously, as well as additional
parameters describing the nature of communication among the users such as
the intensity ratio and the number of steps (as an analogue for time) to run 
the simulation for.
At each stage of the simulation, a randomly chosen subset of all users on the map
was allocated based upon the intensity ratio to attempt to send a message to another
randomly chosen user on the map.
After the number of steps specified is reached, the simulation would continue
to allow all users to complete their re-transmission stacks, which would usually
take a few extra steps to complete.
Once all users had finished their re-transmissions, statistics would be compiled
on a per-user basis, and overall averages would be returned.

The main simulation stage is composed of several smaller elements modeling
the messages and user interactions.
These elements were modeled relatively simplistically, so future additions could be
made to model other complex aspects of communication e.g. multi-packet messages,
fluctuating communication range, power usage, etc.

Finally, the last stage is a statistical analysis layer which enabled taking overall
statistics over a range of parameter values and creating relevant tables and graphs,
which are used in the results portion of this paper.

The language chosen to implement the simulation was Python, due to it's incorporation of 
object-oriented paradigms, as well as the ease of prototyping a larger program in a 
short period of time.
Additionally, the author's knowledge and existence of several data tools made it a natural
fit for this project.
A full listing of all the code created for this simulation is included with this report.
